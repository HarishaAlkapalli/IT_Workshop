Abstract. This is a \LaTeX{} template for 18.821, which you can 

use for your own reports.
	\section{\centering{INTRODUCTION}}
This brief document shows some examples of the use of \LaTeX{} and
	indicates some special features of the Math Lab report style. The course website contains links to several \LaTeX{}manuals.
	End the introduction by describing the contents of the paper sec­
	tion by section, and which team member(s) wrote each of them. For
	instance, Section \textcolor{blue}6 discusses referencing, and is written by P. Gurps.
	\section{\centering{\LaTeX{} Examples}}
		Here are some ways of producing mathematical symbols. Some are pre-deﬁned either in \LaTeX{} or in the AMS a h n this document n
		loads. For instance, sums and integrals, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n.\int^n_0 x dx={n^2}/{2}$
			.We’ve deﬁned a few other symbols at the start of the document, for
		instance \mathbb{N, Q, Z, R}. You can make marginal notes for yourself or your
		co-authors like this:
	   	Unﬁnished here?
		If you want to type.
		\[\int^1_0 xdx=1/2,\]or\[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}i=-\frac{1}{12}\]or\[
	1-1+1-\ldots=\frac{1}{2}.\]

If you want a number for an equation, do it like this:
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\int^n_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi}{6}.
\end{align}
This can then be referred to as (1), which is much easier than keeping
track of numbers by hand. To group several equations, aligning on the\newline
= sign, do it like this:
\[x_1+2x_2+3x_3=7\]
y=mx+c

=4x-9.

You can easily embed hyperlinks into the output .pdf document:
click here for example.
\section{Images}	
Figure \textcolor{blue}1 is an example of a .pdf image put into a ﬂoating environ­
ment, which means LaTeX will draw it wherever there’s enough space
left in your manuscript. Look at the .tex original to see how to insert
a ﬁgure like this.
\section{Theorems and such}
An example of a “conjecture environment” is given below, in Con­
jecture \textcolor{blue}{4.1}. Theorems, lemmas, propositions, deﬁnitions, and such all
use the same command with the appropriate name changed. In fact,
\newpage
THE 18.821 REPORT

if you look at the top of this .tex ﬁle, you can see where we’ve deﬁned
these environments.
\begin{conjecture}[Vaught's Conjecture]Let $T$ be a countable complete theory. If $T$ has fewer than $2^{\aleph_0}$ many countable models (up to isomorphism), then it has countably many countable models.
\end{conjecture}
\begin{theorem}
	When it rains it pours.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Well, yes.
\end{proof}	
\section{FILETYPES USED BY \LaTeX{}}
\begin{flushleft}
	You will write your text as a .tex ﬁle using any text editor (though
	WYSIWYG editors are troublesome). Traditionally one then runs
	\LaTeX{}and obtains a \texttt{.dvi} ﬁle, which can be viewed on the screen using a
	dvi viewer. To include images, and then prepare the ﬁle for printing or
	submission, one typically translates the \texttt{.dvi} into either \texttt{.ps} (Postscript)	or
	 \texttt{.pdf}(Adobe PDF).
	 
Your report will be submitted as a \texttt{.pdf} document. The \texttt{pdflatex}
command produces a \texttt{.pdf} ﬁle directly from a \texttt{.tex ﬁle.} This command
works well with included \texttt{.pdf} ﬁles, but does not handle \texttt{.eps} ﬁles.
An \texttt{.eps} ﬁle can be converted to a .pdf ﬁle by viewing it and saving
as a \texttt{.pdf} ﬁle, or by  \texttt{ps2pdf filename.eps,} which produces
\texttt{filename.pdf}. Under MikTeX with WinEdt, all necessary commands
will appear under “Accessories” in the WinEdt menu.
\end{flushleft}
Finally, Matlab can be made to produce
 \texttt{.eps} ﬁles by typing


 \texttt{print -deps filename} 
 \begin{flushleft} at the prompt.\end{flushleft}
 \section{Quoting sources}
 \begin{flushleft}
 	In your work, keep notes of the literature you’ve used, including
 	websites. Cite the references you use; failure to do so constitutes pla­
 	giarism. Every bibliography item should be referenced somewhere in
 	the paper. Quote as precisely as possible: [1, pages 76–78] rather than
 	\textcolor{blue}{[1]. [2]} was a useful background reference, too
.
